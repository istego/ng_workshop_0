        description: `The American Shorthair is known for its longevity, robust health, calm disposition, good looks, friendliness and gentleness. It is a true native American breed that comes in a variety of colors, although it does not come in a pointed pattern like that of the Siamese. The best known American Shorthairs are the dramatically marked silver tabbies, which have been popular in commercial advertisements and movies.

The American Shorthair ranges in size from medium to large. It is well-built and powerful, with a short, dense coat and large, piercing round eyes. This breed is less square in shape and larger than its counterpart, the British Shorthair. It also has a more oblong rather than a round head, larger ears and longer legs. This is a low-maintenance breed that only requires occasional brushing to keep its coat fresh and manage mild shedding.`

        description: `The Abyssinian is thought by some to be one of the very oldest of all breeds of domestic cats. Abyssinians resemble the sculptural and painted representations of ancient Egyptian cats – they are medium in size, muscular yet elegant, with long, well-arched necks, large alert ears, long legs and exotic, almond-shaped eyes. They come in a variety of color variations, including lavender, blue, chocolate, black silver, fawn, sorrel, ruddy and sorrel silver. A unique characteristic of the Abyssinian is the banding, or “ticking,” on individual hairs. There typically are three or four bands of color on each hair. The Abyssinian’s coat is soft, silky and lustrous, with a full undercoat. The tail is broad at the base, tapering to a point which is the color of the darkest ticking of the coat.

Abyssinians are quite active, social and vocal. They bond closely with their owners and want to be involved in everything that their people do. They are very adaptable to new situations and environments. Abys are intelligent and easy to train; they also are quite good at training their owners to wait on them hand and foot. Abyssinians are not simply ornamental lap cats, although they enjoy a good snuggle and are highly affectionate to their family members. This is a sturdy, smart, witty, fun and funny breed that can be demanding of attention and respect.`

        description: `The American Curl is a highly distinctive cat with elegant, wispy ears that curl backwards in a graceful arc, creating an alert, sophisticated look similar to that of a wild lynx. Kittens of this breed are born with straight ears. Within 4 or 5 days, however, their ears begin to curl back in a tight rosebud formation. Gradually, they unfurl, reaching their permanent shape by about 16 weeks of age. The degree of ear curl varies widely within the breed. Fanciers prefer a more dramatic curl for the show ring, while straighter-eared specimens are typically considered to be pet-quality. Some kittens in American Curl litters never develop the curly-eared trait. This breed is medium-sized, comes in a variety of colors and may be either long or short-haired. Either way, its coat is silky and lies flat, with little-to-no undercoat, so they are not prone to a great deal of shedding. The tail of the American Curl is fluffy and fan-like, said to resemble a feather boa. It should be brushed regularly.

In addition to its unique ears, the American Curl has an extraordinary disposition. People-oriented, playful, faithful and highly affectionate, these cats remain kitten-like well into adulthood, and usually throughout their lives. They are remarkably adaptable to new situations and are not easily stressed. American Curls adjust to almost any type of household, are gentle with children and get along extremely well with most other cats and with dogs. They are rarely territorial and typically can be introduced into a home with established pets with relative ease, as they tend to be very respectful of other animals. American Curls form very close bonds with their primary caretakers. Owners can expect their Curls to follow them from room to room throughout the house - and sometimes, even into the shower. They demand plenty of personal cuddle-time and one-on-one attention. This is an easy-going breed that is eager to please.`

        description: `The American Bobtail is a medium-to-large cat with a solid, muscular body and a luxurious coat. Its tail is naturally “bobbed,” meaning that it is unusually short and preferably should not exceed the hock in length. When this cat is alert, its tail is held straight up. Its head is distinctively wedge-shaped, with a prominent brow over large, slightly almond-shaped eyes, giving it the persistent look of a focused hunter. In overall appearance, the American Bobtail resembles a wild bobcat. It is a slow-maturing breed, taking two to three years to reach full adulthood. The American Bobtail comes in all colors and coat patterns, both in long-haired and short-haired varieties. Its coat is naturally water-resistant, regardless of length. The Bobtail easily adapts to almost any environment, whether it be busy or quiet. They make wonderful household companions.

Despite its rather wild appearance, the American Bobtail is a friendly, highly intelligent, adaptable and personable cat. It is often described as being “dog-like” in temperament. Bobtails are exceptionally affectionate and devoted to their owners and can be quite demanding of attention. They typically get along well with dogs and other cats, even welcoming newcomers of the two or four-legged variety with ease into the household. The American Bobtail is a good traveler and has been a cabin companion for many long-haul truck drivers. They also have been used by therapists to calm distraught patients, because they are well-behaved and unusually sensitive to people in distress.`

As in most breeds, the females are usually smaller than the males, but they do not appear frail or dainty and should not be penalized because of any actual or perceived size difference. The American Wirehair's head is broad, with a prominent chin and well-developed cheekbones set on a well-muscled neck. In profile, their nose shows a gentle indentation. Their ears are medium in size, widely set and slightly rounded at the tips. Their eyes are large, round and piercing. The Wirehair’s feet are rounded, compact and tight. The tail is in proportion to the body, tapering gently from rump to end and being neither blunt nor pointed.

The American Wirehair is characteristically a people-oriented cat, with a strong, affectionate personality and a keen interest in its surroundings. The Wirehair is always looking for a way to amuse himself, and his owner. They have been described as quiet, reserved and loving, although to their owners these cats are personable and active.`

        description: `The Aegean Cat is a naturally developed breed from Greece, which means, these cats developed without external human interference. Although, as a breed, these felines are rare, they are extensively common in their home island of Cyclades in the Aegean Sea. Although the local people have welcomed them inside their households, the feral population of these cats is also large. They are found openly roaming around, or resting on a boundary wall or under the tree shed, or lurking around fishing boats. They are medium-sized cats with semi-long hair and a lean but muscular structure and a thick tail. The almond-shaped eyes of these cats are green. Since this cat has not been recognized by any cat registries, the probability to find it bred as a pet in an American household is less.

Aegean Cats tend to be smart and lively, with good communication skills. They are generally friendly toward people and can be excellent cats for families with children. True to their heritage as island cats, Aegeans don’t disdain water and may even go fishing for themselves. Consider this cat if you’ve always wanted a feline fishing buddy. If you have an aquarium or koi pond, however, you might want to make sure its denizens are protected from a curious cat with a grasping paw. The Aegean Cat usually likes being part of the family and is well suited to most types of homes. He’ll appreciate having an enclosed outdoor area where he can climb or lie out in the sun, but he shouldn’t be allowed to roam.`

Australian Mists are tolerant of handling and are not inclined to scratch. As kittens they are lively, but are less so when mature. Australian Mists can be excellent indoor cats, which also protects native wildlife. Some Australian Mists can be trained to go for walks on a lead. Neutered/spayed cats and kittens of this breed fit in easily with other cats and dogs, a trait further enhanced through selective breeding.`

American Polydactyl cats are bred as a specific cat breed, with specific physical and behavioral characteristics in addition to extra digits. The American Polydactyl is not to be confused with the pedigree Maine Coon polydactyl. The polydactyl form of the Maine Coon is being reinstated by some breeders. A particular strain of polydactyl cats native to Ithaca, New York is known as the Ithacat. Polydactyls are very common in the Cardigan area of Wales, where they are known as "Cardi-cats."`

These cats are neat and take care of themselves very well. Generally speaking, Arabian Maus are quiet, only being vocal when they demand something. However, they do tend to have a high vocal range and their vocalizations can sometimes come across as loud and demanding. Arabian Mau cats were adapted to a desert life style and had to hunt for food themselves; possibly because of this they are not picky about food and they seem to love eating. They like to play and so this breed is very active and curious. They are good hunters, quick and agile. Cats that are allowed to go outdoors will easily catch prey and bring it back home. These cats easily jump and jump high. Outdoor cats like to walk around their territory and their house; Arabian Mau are very territorial breed. Males always guard their territory from other male cats.`

Longhaired Asians of all varieties are called Tiffanies. Asians are grouped in the foreign section at cat shows. It is a medium-sized cat, with a muscular and compact body, which is devoid of fat. It has a broad and rounded chest, and slender legs. The straight tail is of medium length. The pleasantly rounded head has no flattened areas, and there is a very visible spot in profile. This gives the Asian a full-looking face. The round and wide-set eyes come in the colour of yellow.

Asians are very affectionate and lovable, just like its originated brother, the Burmese. It is inquisitive, and loves to explore the house. It has a strong will. It often enjoys traveling in a cat carrier. Asians are highly vocal, and have very loud voices. Owners should note that these cats demand an owner who will pay attention to it, interact with it, and always hug and hold them frequently. This behavior is quite similar to the Burmese. The Asian is a sociable animal with familiar people, but is also sociable even towards strangers sometimes. They are like lap cats, and are playful and energetic for life.`

The Tiffany is a gentle, active and curious breed. Cats of this breed are attached to their owners, but do not always get along with other cats, since they can be quite jealous.

        description: `The British Shorthair, also called the English Cat or simply the “Brit,” is the national cat of the British Isles. This is a compact, muscular and powerful breed that should be "cobby" or chunky in appearance. The British Shorthair has a broad chest, short strong legs and large rounded paws. Its tail is thick at the base, round at the tip and plush but not fluffy. The males are almost always larger than the females; this size difference is more easily recognized in British Shorthairs than in most other domestic breeds. Unlike females, mature males tend to develop prominent chubby cheeks, or jowls, which is another distinguishing gender-based feature.

The British Shorthair – or the “Brit,” as it is sometimes affectionately called - is an easygoing, intelligent, friendly breed. It has been described as being placid, patient and predictable. The British Shorthair’s sweet and gentle nature makes them wonderful, steadfast companions and undemanding family members. They adapt easily to apartment, farm, city or estate living. These are not noisy or pushy cats, although they greatly appreciate and accept affection when it is offered to them.`

        description: `The Birman cat breed, also known as the Sacred Cat of Burma, is a medium to large, semi-longhaired, ivory-colored cat with darker color points on the ears, face, legs and tail and an overall golden sheen. Among its most distinctive features are pure white paws on all four feet called “gloves,” which preferably are symmetrical. Birmans also have white, v-shaped areas on the hind legs that come to a point on the back of the hock; these are called “laces.” Only Birmans with near-perfect glove and lace markings are competitive in the show ring. The Birman’s silky coat is less prone to matting than that of the Persian or Himalayan, although it does require more attention than the coat of a short-haired cat. Birmans come in a number of beautiful colors, including: solid color points in seal, blue, chocolate, lilac, red and cream; parti-points in seal-tortie, blue-cream, chocolate-tortie and lilac-cream; and lynx-points in seal, chocolate, blue, lilac, red, cream, seal-tortie, chocolate-tortie, blue-cream and lilac-cream. Kittens are born almost entirely white. They develop their darker points of whatever color over time. Birmans have round, deep blue eyes set widely above high cheekbones and a slightly Roman-shaped nose. This gives them an especially sweet facial expression. This is a strikingly beautiful breed that gives an overall impression of power and balance.

Birmans have marvelous dispositions. They are friendly, self-assured, extremely inquisitive and playfully outgoing, without being overly pushy. They are known to follow their owners around the house like puppies. Birmans need and appreciate human companionship, and are especially fond of children. This is a happy, trusting and adaptable breed. Its incredible beauty is just icing on the cake.`

        description: `The Burmese is a stocky, smooth-coated cat that descends from ancient cats of Asia. It has become quite popular because of its delightful personality, friendly conversational skills and low-maintenance coat. Burmese are small to medium-sized cats, with broad chests and strong shoulders. They typically weigh much more than one would expect, due to their heavily muscled physique. Burmese are more substantial than their Siamese cousins, although fanciers of the breed may restate this as being fluffier, rather than fatter. British Burmese cats often have longer facial features and a more lithe body structure than the North American Burmese, which have a shorter nose and amore square body shape.

As one of the most sociable and people-oriented of all domestic cat breeds, the Burmese enjoys forming very close bonds with its owners, primary caretakers and other pets in the household. These cats are known for having especially delightful personalities. They are described as being dog-like and sunny of temperament, because by nature they are friendly, kind, gentle and outgoing. Burmese also are usually quite playful, well into adulthood. Given their Siamese ancestors, Burmese can be more vocal than many other domestic feline breeds. However, they tend to be quieter-voiced than the Siamese and typically have a softer, less raucous and more pleasant-sounding meow (with no offense meant to Siamese fanciers, to whom the Siamese voice understandably sounds like the calling of angels). Burmese enjoy having conversations with their people, whether in the home or wherever else they may be. This is a highly intelligent, thoughtful breed. Burmese are known to be extremely affectionate, and they love to snuggle and cuddle with their favorite people.`

        description: `The Balinese is an oriental breed with a fine, silky coat and dark markings (called “points”) on its wedge-shaped face, slender legs and long tail. In overall appearance, the Balinese resembles a longer-haired version of the Siamese, which is actually what it is. They do not have a woolly undercoat and are much less hairy than most other long- and semi-longhaired breeds. They are not predisposed to developing matted coats. The American Cat Fanciers’ Association (CFA) only recognizes certain coat colors in the Balinese, which are the same as those of the purebred Siamese: seal point, blue point, chocolate point and lilac point. However, other color variants were added to the breed standard in May of 2008, under what is now called the Javanese Division. These include: cream, red, smoke and silver solid-color points; lynx (tabby) points in blue, blue-cream, chocolate, chocolate-tortie, cinnamon, cinnamon-tortie, cream, fawn, fawn-cream, lilac, lilac-cream, red, seal, seal-tortie, smoke and silver; and parti-color points in blue-cream, chocolate-tortie, cinnamon-tortie, fawn-cream, lilac-cream, seal-tortie, smoke and silver. Balinese kittens are born with pale coats, developing their darker points as they age. Adult cats tend to keep darkening over time. Balinese have brilliant sapphire-blue eyes and large, wide-set ears. The CFA describes them as being “a svelte, dainty cat, with long tapering lines, very lithe but muscular.” Everything about the Balinese is L-O-N-G, from the tip of its nose to the end of its dramatically-feathered tail, which is among its most distinguishing features. These cats are easy-keepers, require little grooming and are generally less vocal than their Siamese cousins. All in all, this is an elegant, refined, graceful and extremely intelligent breed.

Despite their aristocratic appearance, Balinese are affectionate, friendly, clown-like cats with distinct individual personalities. They are inquisitive and can be quite demanding of attention from their owners. However, at times they only show their personable sides to their human and feline family-members. Some authors have described the Balinese as being curious but a bit aloof with strangers, although this is the subject of debate among breed enthusiasts.`

        description: `The Bengal is a relatively new companion breed. It was created by crossing a domestic cat with a wild Asian Leopard Cat, with the goal being to transfer the wild cat’s exotic markings to a new, tame domestic breed. Today’s Bengals are long, sleek and muscular cats of medium size. They come in a number of different coat colors and patterns. All Bengals have spots, marbling and/or swirls, and many look remarkably like a tiny wild leopard. Bengal kittens are usually born with a fairly coarse, camouflage-patterned coat, which gradually changes to the adult color and characteristics. It can take up to one year for the mature leopard pattern to develop. It is preferred that Bengals have large spots arranged randomly in a horizontal flow, eventually developing into beautiful, peacock-like rosettes.

These beautiful, exotic and playful animals should have the disposition of a loving house cat, with the coloring and markings of a wild leopard. A sound temperament, without overt aggression, is essential in the domestic Bengal breed, given the closeness of its truly wild ancestors. Bengals are naturally inquisitive. They love to cuddle. Bengals are typically extremely affectionate and devoted to all members of their home. They can be wonderful pets, especially if children, other cats and dogs are already established in the household when the Bengal is introduced. The Bengal has a wide range of vocal sounds and frequently communicates through unusual but pleasing chirps, trills and cooing.`

        description: `This cat gives the initial impression of being a miniature leopard. It has a long, lean, somewhat muscular body and a low slung walk, along with spots. The most desired shape of spots on the cats is round, yet somewhat blockish. Triangular, oval, or square spots are acceptable also. The Spangle's coat may be any of the following colors: bronze, gold, blue, brown, charcoal, red, black, silver, or white. They have conspicuous cheekbones and light, large whisker pads. Spangles may look wild, but are purely domestic and adore playing and interacting with their people.

They have a soothing disposition that is in complete contrast to their wild, fearful look. Having an affectionate nature, they enjoy being cuddled and fondled by their owners. Because of their athletic, acrobatic nature they enjoy jumping to great heights. In fact, these curious cats would have a great time seated on your shoulder or the fridge top from they can keep a close watch on whatever is happening around. These sociable, children-friendly cats also mingle well with strangers. They desire their masters to be a part of all the fun activities they do and are not comfortable when left alone for a long time. Having an affinity towards hunting, they will enjoy stalking or pouncing upon their toys, or anything that moves.`

        description: `The Bengal is a domestic cat breed developed to look like exotic jungle cats such as leopards, ocelots, margays and clouded leopards. Bengal cats were developed by the selective breeding of domestic cats crossed then backcrossed and backcrossed once more with hybrids from the Asian leopard cat (ALC), Prionailurus bengalensis bengalensis, and domestic cat, with the goal of creating a confident, healthy, and friendly cat with a highly contrasted and vividly marked coat. Bengal cats are typically larger than the average house cat. Males on average weigh between 10-15 lbs (4.5 – 6.8 kg) and females 8–12 lbs (3.6 – 5.4 kg). The International Cat Association recognizes several Bengal colours (brown, seal lynx point, mink, sepia, silver) and patterns (spotted and marbled) for competition and shows. In the New Traits class, other colours may be shown, as well as longhairs.

Its fierce appearance is a complete contrast to its docile, gentle and sociable behavior. These intelligent, curious cats have a striking resemblance to dogs in terms of their traits. The Cheetoh is an excellent lap cat, loving to be in the company of human beings throughout the day. Being trustworthy, sociable, amicable and affectionate, they are well suited for children, dogs, and other cats. The male cats are not at all hostile, displaying maternal affection towards the kittens as well as the juvenile cats. They have inherited this trait from the Ocicat. They are so fond of playing that they even go to the extent of waking up their owners in the morning to get started. These attention-seeking cats do not like to be on their own so give them company always or bring in another pet in your household to keep it entertained.`

The Devon Rex is an extremely intelligent cat that makes a lively, affectionate companion.

Anything that can be picked up or moved becomes a toy or a target to a Devon Rex. They are highly people-oriented and bond very strongly with their owners. For that reason, ownership of a Devon Rex should be considered a lifelong commitment. They give, and expect to receive, a great deal of devotion, attention and affection. The Devon Rex is not well-equipped to survive outdoors due to its short hair coat. These cats should be kept exclusively indoors.`

The Exotic's body and head-style match that of the Persian, but the breed was separated into its own category in the 1960s. The desired coat is dense, plush and stands away from the body due to the thick undercoat. Because outcrosses are regularly done to Persians, many long-haired kittens occur in Exotic litters. Some associations will register and show these cats as Persians. A bit livelier and more inquisitive than the Persian, Exotics share many of the Persian's gentler personality features.

Known as the lazy man’s Persian, the Exotic Shorthair has the body type and easygoing nature of the Persian but without the coat length and need for daily grooming. With her thick, dense, plush short hair and round face, the Exotic Shorthair has a soft teddy bear look. This sweet feline is affectionate and loyal. The breed is athletic, fun-loving, yet also quiet and sensitive.`
